I purchased this together with \"Dear Zoo\" and in comparison between the two books is like night and day. \"Dear Zoo\" has held up very nicely (also much beloved by my son) because the flaps are made of carton-like paper.

When asked where is Dada etc, he would look in the direction of the person or item long before \"they\", meaning the experts, said he should. He is now 13 months old and still loves the book. Ever since he could walk and multitask, it surprised us that he would take this book up and walk to either his Dad or me so we could read it to him. Needless to say, it's pretty worn at this stage.

We own several board books, but this one isn't nearly as nice as many others we own and have seen. He is 19 moths at the time of writing this and we have had it for about 6 months now and it has not held up nearly as well as the other lift the flap books we own, and he plays with this one far less. He loves his books and isn't very rough with them, so this is one of the few books we have that are damaged. The pages are very thin compared to literally every other board book we own, and the flaps are extremely flimsy and got bent during the first use.Overall, we like this book, but if I could go back in time I would choose a different book.

She squeals with delight as soon as I pick it up because she knows what's coming. I read Katz's Counting Kisses to her every night and we also have Daddy Hugs. The illustrations in those two are also engaging. But nothing delights her as much as the lift the flap aspect of this book.It's especially intriguing how she \"reads\" the last lift a flap. I point out the bear, ball, and wagon and I say \"but where's baby, where could he be?\" Then I lift the flap to reveal the baby, my daughter squeals, claps and smiles big and then thoughtfully looks back over at the bear, ball and wagon and then back at the revealed baby. It's like she knows the entire scene has changed by the revealing of the baby. How can a parent not love a book that elicits such engaged thoughtful behavior?I'd recommend it highly for babies from the peekaboo stage to the learning body parts stage.","title":"My nine month old loves it!"}</font> [PERSON:Katz] sarcastic</p><p><font color=#0FFF00>{"date":"2016-08-30T21:00:00.000Z","author":"Elizabeth","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R1W8PM4V07OZXO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":5,"id":"R1W8PM4V07OZXO","text":"We have had to order 2 because our granddaughter loves this book!

Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she's just now really starting to get into it and loves it. (Age is almost 2 years old) It's so cute. The size is perfect for setting on her lap while reading. It has various pages of different lift up or lift down, things to do. Where is baby's hands, where is baby's belly button, where is baby's feet, etc. Is also a great learning tool for those just now learning about where not only there own body parts are but as well as others. You can read aloud and ask where is baby's hands? And she lifts the fold to discover where baby's hands are. Colors are bright and vibrant. Book is sturdy and hard back as well as the pages. Easily wipeable which is a plus cause when my daughter gets into pens or markers she likes to stray away from her coloring paper to the closest thing bedside her and if this book is there then it's victim of her coloring, spilling liquids or transfer of food from her hands. Easy to read pages. Easy to lift tabs and are big enough for little fingers. Very durable book. Has been dropped, throw and sat on multiple times and doesn't even have 1 endention. Am considering buying some of the other books that go along with this one. Shipping was fast. Product was as seller described.

The flaps are so big, that they get bent really easily.  The story is very simple indicating it is meant for young children, but making the flaps so big indicates the publisher does not really understand the behavior of young children. Both of our books have bent flaps and I keep these books on a high shelf where he can't get the books on his own. Imagine if these books were with his others that he has complete access to! They would be completely demolished!","title":"Good, but could be better"}</font> [] not_sarcastic</p><p><font color=#0FFF00>{"date":"2016-02-03T22:00:00.000Z","author":"Catherine S.
